## API Rate Limits

The application implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage:

- Question Generation: 10 requests per minute per IP
- Recommendations: 10 requests per minute per IP

Rate limit headers are included in API responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Timestamp when the rate limit resets

When rate limit is exceeded, the API returns a 429 status code with an error message.
